		This window allows viewing, copying, deleting, sharing and emailing of both the log files and the data log files that have been generated.
		\n\nIn previous versions of our apps, all log files were stored in External Storage. To do that the app needed to have the ability to read and write to External Storage. Google consider reading and writing to external storage a Dangerous Permission, therefore the apps had to request that permission from the user before we could write those files. That was the standard way most apps wrote to External Storage since Android 6 when permissions were first introduced.
		\n\nWith the release of Android 10 and even more so in Android 11 and 12 major changes were required by Google.  Now instead of writing the log files to external storage, all our log files are written to the internal storage of the app itself.
		\n\nThis in turn has meant we have had to revise the way that we make these files available to you. The procedure is more complex, therefore we recommend that you read the section in our User Guide (search for File Maintenance) to become familiar with the procedure. Remember that these files are your files, your data etc and you are free to use them any way you wish.
